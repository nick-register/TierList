### TierList 
##I'm interested in this project because I see a lot of people using tierlists, and thought it might be a good place to start my coding journey!
#A tierlist is a good way to discuss a topic and sort the subjects within the topic based on a value

#Javascript has been the hardest language to implement, but I'm starting to get a grasp

##7/14:
Breakthrough using jquery to add sorting functionality to the dropdown.
the bank now sorts tiles based on category after selection of "what do you want to sort"

Very exciting.
