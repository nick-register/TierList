### TierList 

##I'm interested in this project because I see a lot of people using tierlists, and thought it might be a good place to start my coding journey!

- A tierlist is a good way to discuss a topic and sort the subjects within the topic based on a value

- Javascript has been the hardest language to implement, but I'm starting to get a grasp.

##7/14:
Breakthrough using jquery to add sorting functionality to the dropdown.
the bank now sorts tiles based on category after selection of "what do you want to sort"

##August 2023:
I've been focusing more on learning Javascript via FreeCodeCamp than updating the Tier List project code. I've also been accepted into the Computer Science program at Oregon State. Finishing this project has been put on pause, though about 80% of the main functionality has been completed. Now, I'll be spending most of my time learning JS, React and Python via OSU and FreeCodeCamp.
